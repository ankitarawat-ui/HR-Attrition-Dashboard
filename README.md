# HR-Attrition-Dashboard

I recently worked on an HR Analytics Dashboard to analyze and understand the key factors
influencing employee attrition in an organization.
Using Power BI, I transformed raw HR data into meaningful insights that help management
take data-driven decisions for better employee retention and satisfaction.
📊 Key KPIs:
Total Employees: 10,005
Employees Left (Attrition): ~2,000
Active Employees: 8,000
Attrition Rate: 22.48%
Average Age: 40 years
🧠 Business Questions Answered

1️⃣ What is the overall attrition rate?
2️⃣ Which departments are facing the highest attrition and why?
3️⃣ How does job role influence attrition rates?
4️⃣ Is distance from home related to attrition?
5️⃣ Is overtime contributing to higher attrition?
6️⃣ How do satisfaction scores affect retention?
7️⃣ Are employees with poor work-life balance more likely to leave?
8️⃣ Does frequent business travel increase attrition?
9️⃣ Does tenure in the same role influence attrition?
🔟 Are salary hikes effective in retaining employees?
